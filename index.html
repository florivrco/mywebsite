                        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                        <p>As part of the national initiative to modernize Jeddah's transportation system, the JPTP aims to transform the city into a more sustainable, accessible, and interconnected urban environment. I was directly involved in a major phase of the project, focusing on the largest and most populated district in Jeddah, where traffic congestion was a critical challenge.</p>

                        <h4>Key Contributions</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Focused Urban Strategy: Led the development and adaptation of transport infrastructure specifically tailored for the largest residential district in Jeddah, addressing high-density traffic areas with long-standing congestion issues.</li>
                            <li>Multi-Modal Transit Hubs: Designed and supported the implementation of intermodal "pulse stations" that integrated public and private transportation modes—combing smart scooters, private car parking, shuttle buses, and BRT access in a single location. This approach reduced car dependency and increased accessibility for residents.</li>
                            <li>Smart Traffic Decongestion: Introduced strategic infrastructure solutions such as dedicated BRT lanes, adaptive signal controls, and optimized pedestrian crossings to facilitate continuous flow and reduce bottlenecks in key corridors.</li>
                            <li>Transit-Oriented Development (TOD): Supported land use coordination and path re-alignment to ensure connectivity between residential areas, commercial centers, and public transit stations, promoting walkability and smart mobility access.</li>
                            <li>Innovative Mobility Tools: Contributed to the planning and spatial analysis using GIS-based simulations and Civil 3D to optimize traffic distribution and enhance modal shift efficiency.</li>
                            <li>Stakeholder Engagement: Collaborated with city planners, public transport authorities, and urban design consultants to ensure that the solutions were feasible, inclusive, and aligned with long-term mobility goals.</li>

                        <h4>My Personal Vision</h4>
                        <p>Integrating AI into project management goes beyond increasing productivity or minimizing errors; it represents a qualitative shift in how humans collaborate with technology. This system makes project management more flexible and responsive to changes, fostering a truly collaborative environment characterized by transparency and accuracy. I foresee these systems becoming more advanced in the future, capable of predicting challenges before they arise and even proposing new opportunities for growth and innovation within projects.</p>
                        <p>In short, an AI-powered project management system is a smart partner supporting every step of the project journey—from concept to completion—ensuring the achievement of objectives with the highest quality and lowest possible cost.</p>
